# Test Report

## Command
`N/A (no automated tests found)`

## Result
FAIL

## Summary
- No automated test runner or scripts detected in repo; manual verification only.

## Failures (if any)
- Automated tests not run (none available).

## Notes
- why this command: CI workflows, package.json scripts, and Makefile were not present; default language test commands were not applicable for this config repo.
- alternatives considered: go test ./..., pytest -q, cargo test, mvn test, gradle test.
- manual checks (from task brief): Open `:Org agenda b` to confirm block agenda sections; punch in (`F9 i`) clocks into default Organization task; keep-running clock out (`F9 O`) falls back to parent/default; punch out (`F9 o`) stops continuous clocking; confirm clock logs in LOGBOOK drawers.
