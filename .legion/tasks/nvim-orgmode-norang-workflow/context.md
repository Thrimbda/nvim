## 关键决策

| 决策 | 原因 | 替代方案 | 日期 |
|------|------|----------|------|
| Risk level set to Low for orgmode workflow changes. | Changes are confined to Neovim config and docs, with easy rollback and no external integrations. | Medium risk if workflow required external services or data migrations. | 2026-02-06 |
| Implement punch in/out via explicit Lua wrapper commands instead of hook-based clock-out automation. | nvim-orgmode does not expose a clock-out hook; wrapping clock out provides deterministic keep-running behavior. | Wait for upstream hook support or rely on manual clock-in to parent/default task. | 2026-02-06 |
| Expose default Organization task ID via vim.g.org_organization_task_id. | Allows a stable user-specific ID without hardcoding in module logic. | Hardcode the ID in orgmode.lua or in org_punch.lua. | 2026-02-06 |
| Keep a single canonical usage doc at docs/orgmode-norang-workflow.md. | User asked 'how to use' directly; updating existing doc avoids duplication and keeps entry point clear. | Create an additional quickstart doc and link between them. | 2026-02-06 |

## 快速交接

**下次继续从这里开始：**

1. Run the manual verification steps in Neovim (see test-report).
2. Optionally address non-blocking review suggestions for extra guardrails.

**注意事项：**

- No automated tests found; test report marked FAIL due to N/A.
- Review report is PASS with non-blocking suggestions only.
